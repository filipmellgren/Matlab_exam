% new steady state value for h. We will also need a starting point for k,
% here I call it kold.

theta = 0.4;

cbar = 0;
r = theta * 1/kdivy;
w = (1-theta) * kdivy^(theta/(1-theta));
kold = h / ((1/kdivy)^(1/(1-theta))); % starting point for transition of k that leads to everything else. 
v = tau0*w*h; % 0.1248. Note this is the same as revenue2c(30)
c = (1-tau0)*w*h + r*kold + v - kold + (1-delta)*kold;
alpha6 = alpha(theta, h, kdivy, tau0, c, cbar, gamma); % 13.34 - what we need most of all
beta = 1 / (theta*(1/kdivy) + (1 - delta)); % 0.9231

% The function assumes w as an exogenous variable in equilibrium.
% This time, it's unecessary restrictive:
w = (1-theta)*kdivy^(theta/(1-theta)); % By doing this, it's enough to assume that k/y is still 3 in equilibrium
% The equations above were taken from the pdf, when I solved for a steady
% state in Q2.
